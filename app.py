> *"Biology helps us uncover the secrets of life â€” and I am driven to be part of that discovery."*

From the first time I engaged in a hands-on biology practical, I felt deeply inspired to understand how the human body works. Since then, biology has become more than just a subject â€” itâ€™s a field I want to explore and contribute to as a future scientist.

st.markdown("""
- My interest in biology grew stronger after a heart dissection during school. Seeing the chambers, valves, and vessels in real life sparked my curiosity.
- A YouTube Short on **genetic mutation** amazed me â€” a single change in DNA can affect an entire organism!
- I explored topics like genetics, hereditary diseases, and reproductive biology.

st.markdown("""
- **Heart Dissection Practical:** I identified atria, ventricles, and valves, linking theory to real-life biology.
- **Food Tests & Respiration Experiments:** I ensured accuracy in measurements and understood how glucose and oxygen fuel our cells.

These experiences helped me develop **lab discipline**, **accuracy**, and **scientific thinking**.
