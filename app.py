st.markdown("""
> *"Biology helps us uncover the secrets of life — and I am driven to be part of that discovery."*

From the first time I engaged in a hands-on biology practical, I felt deeply inspired to understand how the human body works. Since then, biology has become more than just a subject — it’s a field I want to explore and contribute to as a future scientist.

st.header("🧠 Why I Want to Study Biology")
st.markdown("""
- My interest in biology grew stronger after a heart dissection during school. Seeing the chambers, valves, and vessels in real life sparked my curiosity.
- A YouTube Short on **genetic mutation** amazed me — a single change in DNA can affect an entire organism!
- I explored topics like genetics, hereditary diseases, and reproductive biology.

# --- Section 3 ---
st.header("🔬 School Lab Experiences")
st.markdown("""
- **Heart Dissection Practical:** I identified atria, ventricles, and valves, linking theory to real-life biology.
- **Food Tests & Respiration Experiments:** I ensured accuracy in measurements and understood how glucose and oxygen fuel our cells.

These experiences helped me develop **lab discipline**, **accuracy**, and **scientific thinking**.

# --- Section 4 ---
st.header("📚 Self-Learning & Exploration")
st.markdown("""
Beyond school, I watch educational videos and explore topics like:

- **Sexual reproduction** and its role in genetic diversity
- **Human transport systems** — how oxygen and nutrients travel through our body
- **Gene therapy** and the future of medical innovation
